### How we use waffle
* Backlog is for all possible work that could one day get done.
* Ready is for all the work that ready to get done.
* Current Sprint is what you are commiting to have done by the end of the sprint
* In Progress is what you are working on right now. Can inlcude things outside and bigger than a sprint.
* Done is done.

### cadence
